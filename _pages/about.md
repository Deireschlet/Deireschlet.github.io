Hello! I'm Stefan Krieger, a math student at the University of Vienna with a passion for technology and finance. My academic focus includes machine learning, data science, and financial mathematics, where I've worked on projects like credit card fraud detection and chess position analysis.

Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at Lumos Student Data Consulting, working on exciting projects like Optical Character Recognition for invoice data. My previous roles in technical support and finance have provided me with a diverse skill set, from diagnosing technical issues to analyzing financial situations.

At university, I also serve as a Faculty Representative for Mathematics, where I help organize meetings and support fellow students. You can connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my projects on Medium. Let's connect and explore the world of math, tech, and finance together!
